DESCRIPTION:<ul>\n<li>Current state on Nix install on Linux.</li>\n<li>Wh
 at Linux users and professionals in Nix* world experience first. And wha
 t first impression they get.</li>\n<li>Demonstration of more polished in
 stallation process that submitted upstream.</li>\n<li>Picture of competi
 tive technologies for today. Snap\, Docker\, Kubernetes\, Ansible\, Terr
 aform. Thay solve the same problems but in more clunkier way\, we need t
 o hurry up before last puzzle peace - Snap\, goes into place (becomes st
 able enough for business) in 8-9 month.</li>\n<li>Description of why Sna
 p is a clever lockdown.</li>\n<li>We should get Linux community and mark
 etshare before Snap takes everything. Lets invade enthusiasts and busine
 ss with Nix and NixPkgs solution.</li>\n<li>Importance of integration in
  Linux tech world and community. And what Linux going to get\, what buss
 iness would get. And what the whole Nix* ecosystem would greatly benefit
  from.</li>\n<li>Call to help merge\, to collaborate\, to take ideas\, c
 ode. Because author cares only to spread Nix in Linux more\, before Snap
  would seize the whole market and technologies that are widely used - be
 come complette stack and become "good enough" without any involvement of
  Nix* in the market.</li>\n</ul>
