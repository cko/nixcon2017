DESCRIPTION:NixOS offers plenty of advanced technical features that make 
 everyone's eyes shine with happiness: declarative system configuration\,
  atomic upgrades\, rollbacks\, reproducible system configurations\, mult
 i-user package management\, and so on and so forth. Basically\, we rock!
  Many professional Linux users would love to have those capabilities ava
 ilable on their machines. Yet\, professional users cannot make do withou
 t some rather basic features that NixOS lacks\, like\, offering speciali
 zed code paths for desktop users and server installations\, binding cust
 omer service-level agreements\, long-term support releases with regular 
 maintenance updates for 3 years of longer\, and -- last\, but not least 
 -- fast and reliable security updates. The purpose of this talk is to ou
 tline ways how we\, as a community\, might be able to improve upon that 
 situation.
