DESCRIPTION:For the past couple of years\, Darwin has been a first-class 
 "pure" platform on Nix. In this talk I'll describe the many hurdles we'v
 e had to overcome to get from an impure poorly supported platform to whe
 re we are today. I'll also cover ongoing pain points and where we see th
 e platform going\, and why I think it should take over the Mac packaging
  ecosystem.\n
