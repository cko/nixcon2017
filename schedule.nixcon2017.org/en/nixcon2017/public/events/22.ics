DESCRIPTION:LumiGuide develops and maintains bicycle and car parking guid
 ance systems that are deployed in various cities in the Netherlands and 
 abroad. To run this system a number of different machines are needed: im
 age analysis servers deployed locally in facilities\, central web-server
 s and support servers in data centers\, embedded machines like Raspberry
  Pi's and ARM FPGA's to power our various displays in facilities and on 
 the streets. Finally our engineers have workstation to write our softwar
 e. \n\nAll these machines need to be developed\, tested\, provisioned\, 
 configured\, installed and rolled back (in case we make a mistake). Sinc
 e we don't have a dedicated sys-admin we rely on automation to do most o
 f these tasks. We use the Nix ecosystem of tools to help us with that.\n
 \nI will talk about how we've structured our mono-repository\, how we ma
 ke sure each engineer uses the exact same version of nixpkgs and the exa
 ct same NixOS configuration\, how we override our Haskell packages\, how
  we use Continuous Integration wit hydra and how we deploy our machines 
 using nixops.\n\nFinally I will also talk about the things that we don't
  like about the Nix ecosystem.
